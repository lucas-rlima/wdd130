            <p>Hello! My name is Lucas Lima and I am from Tupa, SP Brasil. I like 
                to spend time with my family and enjoy moments with them. I'm studying 
                at BYU Idaho and I am excited to acquire new knowledge.
                I started to have an introduction to software development during my high school, at the time I took 
                a course along with high school and learned programming logic, some database concepts, delphi and web language.
                Today all this knowledge is helping me a lot in BYU studies and has been easier to understand because I had seen 
                a little about the subject before. I am very interested in being able to learn more and more and also to one 
                day be able to work as a developer.
            </p>
